        Thankyou for showing showing interest
        here is breif story of me and my tech 
        journey. My tech journey started 2021
        when the pandemic was almost over. few 
        month before i started it was easy the 
        time was difficult you have to dedicate 
        almost 70 hours in a week that is 10 hours
        a day, it was not easy and i was not eating 
        well cause of it. so i stayed for the 
        program about a month until i saw an ad
        online about alt school africa, i checked 
        the school and i loved it and the time for 
        very convinient for me so i paid for their 
        fees and selected front-end engineering as 
        the course, and it involved html and css and 
        js. As i started the course it was easy at
        first then it got little bit difficult and 
        confusing but i pushed through and i learnt
        a lot about html, css, and js though i did 
        not really understand js very well but i 
        continued and focused on html and css.
        so it was exam time at the school, i was 
        scared because i hate exams, but i had no 
        option and i took it but fotunately i passed 
        and i am still waiting for second term 
        but i am still keeping my self busy and doing 
        personal and i love it
