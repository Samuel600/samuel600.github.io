                    1989, Tim Berner Lee invented the web with
                    HTML as its publishing language. The language 
                    evolved from its version1.0 with limited tags
                    and capabilities to now HTML 5 which has more
                    capabilities.
                    <br><br>let us now look at the program :<br>

                <p>HTML is the standard markup language.

                    In html, if we wanted the content above
                    to be a stand alone paragraph we Would
                    put it in a paragraph element. 
                    The web browser will then display "hello 
                    HTML" when the web page with the content 
                    opened in it.
                    <br>
