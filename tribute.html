        ABOUT THE LEGEND
    </h1>
<p>
    <strong> in Onitsha in 1961, Obi graduated from the University of Niger in 1984. </strong>
    Afterwards he entered business and banking, eventually rising to hold 
    several high-ranking executive positions at banks. 
    By the early 2000s, Obi was the chairman of Fidelity Bank before leaving the position to enter politics.
    Obi ran for governor in 2003, as a member of the All Progressives Grand Alliance but his main opponent was
    unlawfully declared victor. 
    After three years of legal battles, Obi was declared winner in 2006 and assumed office in March 2006. 
    He was impeached in November the same year,
    before his impeachment was overturned and he returned to office in February the next year, 2007. Again,
    Obi was removed when the 2007 Anambra State gubernatorial election; 
    the election was held in accordance to the timeframe of the normal Nigerian electoral calendar of a four year election interval, 
    which in this case dated back to his first, previously annulled election was held. 
    But the judiciary intervened again and ruled that he should be allowed to complete a full four-year term. 
    In 2010, he won re-election to a second term.
    <strong>Obi's terms were marked by improvements in state finances, education, and healthcare.</strong>
